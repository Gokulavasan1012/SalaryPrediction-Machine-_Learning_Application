# Software-Developer's Salary Prediction 

##Purpose of the Project:
<br>
                     *The purpose of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict software developer salaries. This project helps the job seekers to get an idea of their salary expectations.
                     <br>
                     * This project is a practical machine learning project that can help individuals interested in data science and machine learning to enhance their skills. This project will serve as a valuable                           learning resource for anyone looking to understand how to work with real-world data and build predictive models.

##Project's Technology Stack:<br>
                     * Python Pandas - Pandas is one of the Python library used for data anlysis. In this project we use pandas to clean the data and to do several data anlysis operations.
                     <br>
                     * Python Numpy - Numpy is called as Numerical Python which is one of the Python library used to perform complex numerical operations.
                     <br>
                     * Python StreamLit- StreamLit is a open source Python library which is used to create and share Machine learning application. It helps us to create required web pages and also takes care of database requirements of our project.
